This is an empty R Project that uses renv for library management and produces basic html files. renv setup is detailed in the readme html and a very simple data presentation page is previewed in the Analysis_1 Rmd & html pages... The git aspect of this project has a restrictive .gitignore file (only sending .Rmd, .R, .html, and .txt files to git) and explicitely ignoring any renv/ folder... 

The idea is to clone, rename, and then be quickly setup with a project for R analysis work with version control and git tracking...
